# TWITCH ANTI AFK BY REN.

- WORK WITH GOOGLE CHROME
- OPEN GiveMeValorant to launch the anti AFK software.
- OPEN Run to launch and the anti AFK software and the console to always check the software status 
  (Usefull in case of error). 

I made this software to drop Valorant, so thats why the name "GiveMeValorant". 

This software is quite simple, it will send a custom message in the chat of your selected streamer to avoid Twitch to set your status as AFK. Once followed the few steps just dont close the software and the browser. 

I am not responsible for a bad use of this software or for damage to your hardware using it.   

Poi oh il programma Ã¨ in Italiano quindi che cazzo faccio la desc in inglese... GG.
